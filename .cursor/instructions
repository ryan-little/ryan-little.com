# Cursor Instructions for Ryan Little Website

## When working on this project:

1. **Always maintain the space theme** - This is a space-themed portfolio with satellite navigation
2. **Preserve mobile responsiveness** - The site has mobile-specific code in `src/js/mobile.js`
3. **MAINTAIN FEATURE PARITY** - Mobile and desktop versions must have identical functionality
4. **PRESERVE EXISTING FOUNDATION** - Build upon the current codebase rather than rewriting from scratch
5. **Keep animations smooth** - The site features shooting stars and satellite animations
6. **Update file references** - When moving files, update HTML script and link tags
7. **Test in browser** - Always verify changes work before committing
8. **Maintain modular structure** - Keep JavaScript files organized in `src/js/`
9. **Optimize for performance** - Use WebP images with PNG fallbacks
10. **Follow the established patterns** - The codebase has specific animation and interaction patterns

## Key files to be aware of:
- `index.html` - Main entry point with satellite navigation
- `src/js/main.js` - Core application logic
- `src/js/animations.js` - Animation system
- `src/js/mobile.js` - Mobile-specific functionality
- `src/styles.css` - Main stylesheet with space theme
- `assets/images_webp/` - Optimized WebP images
- `assets/images/` - PNG fallback images

## Common tasks:
- Adding new animations: Update `src/js/animations.js`
- Mobile improvements: Modify `src/js/mobile.js`
- Styling changes: Edit `src/styles.css`
- New features: Add to appropriate `src/js/` file
- Asset management: Keep in `assets/` with both WebP and PNG versions
- **ALWAYS update CHANGELOG.md** when making any changes to the project
